## 1 - The GUI API (Processing)

Since Swing and AWT were not made for creating games and are quite restrictive in terms of interface design, we decided to use Processing to build our GUI. We chose Processing because its grants a lot more freedom when designing interfaces, it is fairly easy to use, and also because both of us have already used it in the past.

Processing comes with its own IDE and is meant to be used as a "standalone" language (in a similar way to Arduino). However, since it is a Java library in the first place, it can also be imported and used in a Java project, which is how we used it to build our Tetris project.

## 2 - The interface

The interface of our game is mostly inspired by Tetris 99. It's the most recent Tetris game playable.
